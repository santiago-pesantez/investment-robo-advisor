## Summary

This project combines the power of AWS with Python to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

* Robo advisor initial configuration: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

* Build and test the robo advisor: Making sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

* Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Creating an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.
